# capping_UI

This is a simple UI to display 4 types of metrics. Those metrics are CPU utilization, per CPU Core utilization, memory 
utilization and processes statistics. 

## Running the Applicaiton
You must have the flutter sdk installed. It can be found [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). 
Once you have the sdk installed you can build the project with "flutter build web". This generates the build directory 
with all of the required elemnts to host on a web server. 

If you do not want to use a pre-built version of this UI you can simply start the UI in chrome assuming you have chrome
setup as a device for flutter,  see [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/web) for instructions on how to do that.
To start the UI in chrome you should navigate to this directory and run `flutter run --release -d Chrome`. This will 
build and run the application in Chrome.
